# Employee Data Analysis Project

##  Description
This project focuses on creating, storing, and analyzing employee data using Python. The data includes employee names, domains (areas of expertise), ages, locations, salaries, and years of experience. The project demonstrates data handling, manipulation, and exploration techniques using libraries such as `pandas` and `openpyxl`. Additionally, visualizations are generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

##  Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `openpyxl`: For creating and managing Excel files.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.

You can install these libraries using pip:
  - pip install openpyxl pandas matplotlib seaborn

##  Usage
    - Creating the Data: The script first creates an Excel file with employee data and saves it as data.xlsx.
    - Loading the Data: It then reads this Excel file into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

##  Running the Notebook

To run the code, open the Jupyter Notebook (Employee_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb) and execute the cells. The key steps include:

    Importing necessary libraries.
    Creating and saving the Excel file with employee data.
    Loading the data into a pandas DataFrame.
    Displaying the DataFrame and its structure.
    Performing data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Running on Google Colab

To run the notebook on Google Colab:

    Upload the Employee_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb file to Google Drive.

    Open the notebook in Google Colab.

    Install the necessary libraries using:
        !pip install openpyxl pandas matplotlib seaborn


## Data Overview

The data consists of the following columns:

    NAME: The name of the employee.
    DOMAIN: The area of expertise or job domain.
    AGE: The age of the employee.
    LOCATION: The location where the employee is based.
    SALARY: The salary of the employee.
    EXP: The years of experience the employee has.

## Analysis Steps

    Data Creation: An Excel file is created with specified employee data.
    Data Loading: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
    Data Exploration: The structure and contents of the DataFrame are explored, including the number of rows and columns.
    Data Visualization: Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn to explore data trends and patterns.

## Conclusion

  This project demonstrates basic data handling and exploration using Python. It serves as a foundation for more detailed analysis and data visualization, highlighting key aspects of employee data management and  analysis
