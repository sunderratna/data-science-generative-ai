## Project Overview

In this project, we cover the fundamental steps required to preprocess data before feeding it into a machine learning model. These steps ensure that the model can accurately interpret the data, leading to better results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains both numerical and categorical features, with some missing values that needed to be handled. It also includes features requiring encoding and scaling to prepare the data for modeling.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Importing Libraries

We use several essential libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for preprocessing and model preparation.

### 2. Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded and processed, ensuring the correct selection of independent and dependent variables for preprocessing.

### 3. Handling Missing Values

Handling missing values is an essential preprocessing step. In this project, missing values in the dataset were replaced using the mean of the available data, ensuring a more consistent dataset for modeling.

### 4. Encoding Categorical Data

Since machine learning models do not interpret categorical variables, we transformed the categorical data into numerical values. This was applied to both independent and dependent variables to make them machine-readable.

### 5. Splitting the Dataset

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, allowing us to train the model on one portion of the data and test its performance on unseen data, ensuring a more robust model.

### 6. Feature Scaling

To address the issue of features with varying scales, feature scaling was applied to standardize the data. This step improves the model's ability to understand relationships between attributes with different ranges.

## Conclusion

Preprocessing the data is a vital part of the machine learning workflow. This project highlights the importance of:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Splitting the dataset
- Performing feature scaling

These steps contribute to better accuracy and performance in the final machine learning model.
