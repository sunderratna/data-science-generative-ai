# Employee Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
## Project Overview

This project focuses on converting raw data into a clean and analysis-ready format, followed by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset used in this project contains employee information such as name, domain, age, location, experience, and salary. The key tasks performed include data cleansing, missing value treatment, data type conversion, univariate and bivariate analysis, outlier detection, and variable transformation.

## Project Structure

- **Raw Data Import**: Reading the data from an Excel file using `pandas`.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Removing noisy characters from textual columns.
  - Extracting numerical values from mixed-type columns.
  - Handling missing values using appropriate strategies.
  - Converting data types to suitable formats for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Conducting univariate and bivariate analysis.
  - Identifying and treating outliers.
- **Variable Identification**: 
  - Separating independent and dependent variables.
- **Variable Transformation**: 
  - Applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
